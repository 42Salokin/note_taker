# Note Taker
  ## Description
  [![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

  This application allows the user to write and save notes. It utilizes a standard front end with HTML, CSS, and Javascript, which connects to an Express.js back end and a JSON file for data storage. The user will be presented with the option to create a new note, or to display a previously created note from a list in the sidebar. Upon creating a new note, the note will be added to the sidebar list, and can be reselected and displayed. Any notes in the sidebar can also be deleted.
